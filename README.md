## The beginning:

when E.wesam give us this mission said that We are supposed to make it without a button and when the webpage converts some word it is supposed to  process the words and display an appropriate advertisement for the word that was heard... 
so I tried hard to do as he says, and guess what!!! I did it ^_^...

2. first of all you need to allow the page to connect to the microphone, then you can talk and it will save your word automatically to the database.
