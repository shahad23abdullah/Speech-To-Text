## The beginning:

when E.wesam give us this mission said that We are supposed to make it without a button and when the webpage converts some word it is supposed to  process the words and display an appropriate advertisement for the word that was heard... 
so I tried hard to do as he says, and guess what!!! I did it ^_^...


## web page:
1. first of all I will show you my web page ...

2. first of all you need to allow the page to connect to the microphone, then you can talk and it will save your word automatically to the database.
